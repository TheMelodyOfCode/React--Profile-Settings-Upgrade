# REACT - Tic Tac Toe

#### React APP
> - Run the app from the main folder - npm start</br>
 runs on localhost:3000</br>

#### Overview
> the exercise in this project was about:</br>
> - tic tac toe game with useState</br>
> - managed and derived state</br>
> - setting and getting Data from localStorage</br>
> - flexible localStorage Hook</br>
> - game history feature</br>

##### Managed State 
> - State that you need to explicitly manage </br>

##### Dervived State
> - State that you can calculate based on other state</br>

##### State mutation
> - You don't want to mutate the state that's being managed, since it can lead to unexpected bugs</br>
React relies on the fact that anytime there is a state change, it triggers a rerender. </br>
by mutating things, it could have some stale closures that are refrencing the mutated values.</br>
