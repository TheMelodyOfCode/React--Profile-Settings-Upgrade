# REACT - Profile-Settings-Upgrade
### Context-Module-Function

#### Upgrade  
> This is an upgrade to my series of Profile-Settings projects    
> I've been told this is overkill, but fun nevertheless  

> **General functionality:**  
>> Get userdata from firestore  
>> Store data to localstorage  
>> Update Username, Tagline & Biography  
>> Check if a bad word got entered in one of the form fields  

#### Firebase
> In the Utils Folder, you will find all files related to Firebase</br>
>> Normally we would store all the user related data when the user signs up</br>
>> But this is just an exercise about updating the user information.</br>
>> Therefor you will find a user_DATA.js file for Firestore db in case you want to create your own.</br>
